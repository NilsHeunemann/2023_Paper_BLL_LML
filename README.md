# Improved uncertainty quantification for neural networks with Bayesian last layer (in pytorch)

Dear visitor, 

thank you for your interest in this work. This package uses the code supplied for the paper  "Improved uncertainty quantification for neural networks with Bayesian last layer" and adapts it to pytorch. 
Great care was taken to adapt the original code faithfully, while also ensuring correct results. In testing only minor numerical errors due to different implementations of numpy / pytorch were found. If you find any bugs or inconsistencies please let me know using the [issues](https://github.com/NilsHeunemann/2023_Paper_BLL_LML/issues).
